This program exists for one reason: GAtaxx was dropped from the GNOME games
package, and I'm not aware of a good replacement for it*.  Also, I wrote an
Ataxx clone in Delphi whilst at university, which contained my first - and, at
time of writing, only - attempt at board game AI, so the game holds some
sentimental value for me.  You can probably guess what the program was called.
	Enjoy.  :)
